# Card Form and Testing with Jest

#### Lap 1 - Week 1 - Day 2

Exercise for the Auguste Cohort of the Futureproof Bootcamp.

## Objective

- Implement a form
- After the form is submitted the following should happen:
  - the form disappears
  - a celebration card appears (with custom content from user input)
- Testing the DOM with Jest

### Technology used

- HTML and CSS
- Javascript
- Jest
- Jest-environment-jsdom
- Watchify
- Concurrently

### The Good

- The form is working, it is clickable and the celebration card appears with the right text
- I have managed to test a few elements of the form

### The Bad

- I couldn't manage to test the card as I haven't found a way to simulate a click event

### TODO

- Look for a separate testing tool that allows firing click events
- Try to download a picture from Unsplash and add that as a background to the card

### TEAM
